## Library Management System

In this project you will be building “Library Management System” using object-oriented programming techniques. This program will use books.txt file that you will create as a database where each line will represent a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.
1. Create a class named “Library”:

a. Create the constructer method to open the books.txt file, and destructor method to close the file.

Tip: If you open books.txt with “a+” mode, you can both read and append lines to the file. And also, if books.txt is not created previously, this mode will create the file.

2. Add the following methods to library:

a. List Books - This method will list all the books in the books.txt file.

i. Read the contents of the file.

ii. Add each line to a list using splitlines() method of the string object.

iii. Now each element of the list holds information about a single book. Print book names and authors using this information.


b. Add Book - This method will add a book to a books.txt file.

i. Ask user input for book title, book author, first release year and number of pages

ii. Create a string with this information. Add book title then comma then author then comma etc.

iii. Append this line to the file.


c. Remove Book - This method will delete the book with the given title from the books.txt.

i. Ask the user input for book title.

ii. Read the file contents and add book to a list (just like you did while creating a list books method).

iii. Find the index of the book to be deleted in the list.

iv. Remove the book from the list.

v. Remove the contents of the books.txt.

vi. Add all elements of the list to the books.txt.

* With this method you remove contents of the books.txt and rewrite the new list. If you don’t remove the contents, it will add the same books again to the file.


3. Create an object named “lib” with “Library” class.

4. Create a menu to interact with the “lib” object.

a. Print the following to the screen

*** MENU***
1) List Books
2) Add Book
3) Remove Book

b. Ask user input for menu item and assign the input to a variable.

c. Using if-elif-else statement check the user input.

d. According to the user input, run the relevant method of the “lib” object.
